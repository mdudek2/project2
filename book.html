  <h2>The Hunger Games</h2>
  <img class="imageR" src="images/hungergames.jpg" alt="Hunger Games book cover">
  <p>My favorite book of all time would have to be The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. I really enjoyed the dystopian setting and I thought that the concept of a bunch of</p>
  <p>people being forced into a large arena to fight for the entertainment of others was very interesting. I bought this book when I was in 6th grade at my school's bookstore</p>
  <p>and I finished it in a single 6 hour reading session. I simply could not put it down no matter how hard I tried, and while I did enjoy the other two books in the series I feel</p>
  <p>that The Hunger Games is by far the best out of the three by far.</p>

  <h2>Of Mice and Men</h2>
  <img class="imageR" src="images/ofmiceandmen.jpg" alt="Of Mice and Men cover">
  <p>Another book that I really enjoyed was Of Mice and Men. I was required to read this book over the summer for my high school english class and I originally hated it, but</p>
  <p>as time went on I realized that it was actually a really good book about loneliness and about how many people never really get to live out their dreams. To this day the</p>
  <p>ending makes me cry because I just can't help but feel bad for both George and Lenny. I can't imagine what it must be like having to shoot your best friend.</p>

  <h2>The Last Wish</h2>
  <img class="imageR" src="images/witcher.jpg" alt="The Last Wish Book cover">
  <p>I was originally introduced to The Witcher because of the games. I absolutely loved the story and the world in The Witcher 3, so I decided to give the books a try.</p>
  <p>I ended up liking the book even more than I liked the game. The Last Wish focuses on Geralt who is a witcher. A witcher is basically just a person who has been mutated</p>
  <p>in order to make them faster, stronger, and much more dangerous than a normal human so that they can fight monsters. These mutations also have the added side affect of</p>
  <p>taking away a persons emotions. The book is essentially a collection of short stories about Geralt taking on jobs and killing monsters for money. However there is more to</p>
  <p>it than that. The book also incorporates many moral dillemas and uses them to teach important moral lessons. One of the most important of these lessons is that there is not</p>
  <p>always a morally correct choice in life. Sometimes no matter what you do you will end up having to choose between two evils.</p>
