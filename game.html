  <h1 id="title">My Favorite Video Game</h1>
  <img class="imageR" src="images/starwars.jpg" alt="Star Wars Empire at War Cover Art">
  <p>My favorite game of all time has to be Star Wars Empire at War. It is an RTS game that came out around 2006. It has both land and space battles which I think is very cool.</p>
  <p>Ive been playing this game since I was 6 years old and it has been a big part of my childhood. The game has aged quite a bit and it shows but it has a very active community</p>
  <p>that has kept it alive through modding over the years. The mods are the best part of the game and some of them completely change how the game looks and completely overhaul it's visuals.</p>

  <h2>Star wars Empire At War with no mods</h2>
  <img class="imageR" src="images/eaw1.jpg" alt="Star Wars Empire at War with no mods">
  <p>This is how the game looks with no mods installed. While it may have looked good in 2006 by our current standards it's not that good and could definitely use a lot of improvments.</p>
  <p>I do still enjoy playing the game without mods but at this point I have over 1000 hours in total logged into this game so I usually end up modding the game.</p>

  <h2>Star Wars Empire at war with the Remake Mod installed</h2>
  <img class="imageR" src="images/eaw2.jpg" alt="Star Wars Empire at War with remake mod">
  <p>This is Empire At War with the Remake Mod installed. The difference is night and day. The visuals are far superior and there are many new effects that simply did not exist when the game</p>
  <p>was made back in 2006. There are also many new ships that are in the Remake mod that were not present in the original game. Mods such as this one are basically complete overhauls of</p>
  <p>the game. It honestly feels like you're playing a completely different game.
